      <h2>Logistics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Hotels:</em> We're working with our friendly planner to put together a hotel block with actual reservations, and you can trust that this is upcoming. Note that it'll probably be something affordable like a Holiday Inn Express. For something different, you're free to book things yourself - we recommend the <a href="https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/charlottesville">Omni</a> for upscale shiny rooms or various <a href="https://www.visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/lodging/campgrounds-and-retreats/">Albemarle County campgrounds</a> if you'd prefer a tent.
        <li><em>Transport:</em> Charlottesville is quite accessible for many of the guests, about a 5-6 hour drive from either Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, and a quick drive or train ride from Washington. If you're coming from further away, like Minneapolis, the <a href="http://www.gocho.com/">CHO Airport</a> has reasonably convenient connections through American, Delta, and United.
        <li><em>Attire:</em> Fairly stuffy and wedding-ish, but remember that we'll be out on a deck in the woods in the summer. It's not clear whether or not Elijah will wear a tie.
        <li><em>More to Come!</em> We have plenty more to tell you and this page will be updated when more complete invites go out. If you have ideas for what information guests would like, let us know and we'll think it through.
      </ul>

      <a id="gifts" class="anchor"> </a>
      <h2>Gifts</h2>
      <p>As you're shopping for Christmas presents this December, the following might be useful to know in advance: We won't be opening a gift registry for the wedding.</p>

      <p>Instead, at the wedding you'll find, tucked away somewhere in the late-May atmosphere, a Christmas tree that we're asking guests to decorate. We'd love if every attendee could bring an ornament. This'll form the basis of how we'll end up decorating pretty much every year from here on out.</p>

      <p>Given that it's easier to buy Christmas ornaments in December, we figured we'd let you know now.</p>

      <a id="rsvp" class="anchor"> </a>
      <h2>Address Bucket</h2>
        <p>We'd love to send you a printed invitation once more details are finalized. Please send us your happiest mailing address with the form below and we'll make sure it gets ferried to the right place when the time comes. If you want to let us know anything else ahead of time, please send us a note at <a href="mailto:mcmayfest@gmail.com">mcmayfest@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        If for any reason you actively <em>don't</em> want to receive a printed invitation, this website will keep getting filled out with more and more interesting details over time.</p>

        <p>Note that this isn't an RSVP. We're just excited to send you an invitation!</p>
