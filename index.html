      <h2>Hotels</h2>
      <h4>Option 1: <a href="http://www.ihg.com/hotelindigo/hotels/us/en/pittsburgh/pithb/hoteldetail">Hotel Indigo</a> in East Liberty</h4>
      <p>This hotel is run by the Intercontinental/Holiday Inn group; it's their "Boutique" hotel, which means it's got some <a href="http://www.ihg.com/hotelindigo/hotels/us/en/pittsburgh/pithb/hoteldetail#collapse_1">kind of interesting decor.</a> Also, it's big; we have 45 rooms here reserved for $170/night, and it's right next to the afterparty venue. We will have a shuttle from the Indigo to the Mattress Factory for the wedding and then coming back after.</p>
      <p><b>Stay here if:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>You want the simplest option.</li>
        <li>You definitely want to go to the afterparty.</li>
        <li>You want two double beds instead of one large bed; 15 of our rooms here have this setup.</li>
        <li>You want to stay in a up-and-coming/rapidly-gentrifying neighborhood of Pittsburgh that Tati and I like.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="http://www.ihg.com/hotelindigo/hotels/us/en/pittsburgh/pithb/hoteldetail?qAdlt=1&qBrs=6c.hi.ex.rs.ic.cp.in.sb.cw.cv.ul.vn&qChld=0&qFRA=1&qGRM=0&qGrpCd=VTW&qIta=99801505&qPSt=0&qRRSrt=rt&qRef=df&qRms=1&qRpn=1&qRpp=12&qSHp=1&qSmP=3&qSrt=sBR&qWch=0&srb_u=1&icdv=99801505">Book using this link</a> (or call in and tell them you're with the Tasse Vlahovic group) by May 24, to get the discounted rate. They have cheaper rates too for CMU people ($152) or government ($130).
      </p>
      <h4>Option 2: <a href="http://thepriory.com/">The Priory Hotel</a> on the North Side</h4>
      <p>This restored Victorian hotel (formerly a monastery) is a Pittsburgh one of a kind. They're about a mile from the Mattress Factory and have a shuttle that can take you there (or anywhere downtown). We have 15 rooms reserved here: 10 queen rooms for $145 and 5 king rooms for $180. </p>
      <p><b>Stay here if:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>You want transportation to be easy.</li>
        <li>You probably won't be interested in an afterparty at 11pm.</li>
        <li>You want easy access to downtown touristy things.</li>
        <li>You like the Victorian style.</li>
        <li>You don't mind booking early.</li>
      </ul>
      Tell them you're in the Tasse Vlahovic Wedding group, and <a href="http://www.thepriory.com/res.php">book</a> by May 10, to get the discounted rate.
      </p>
      <h4>Option 3: Other places on the North Side</h4> 
      <p>The North Side actually has a handful of other good bed and breakfasts, including the <a href="http://www.innonthemexicanwarstreets.com/">Inn on the Mexican War Streets</a> ($160-220), the Caribbean-themed <a href="http://theparadorinn.com/">Parador Inn</a> ($160), and the (coming soon) <a href="http://www.alleghenyinn.com">Allegheny Inn</a>. There are also a good bunch of <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/mattress-factory--Pittsburgh--PA--United-States?checkin=06%2F24%2F2016&checkout=06%2F26%2F2016&guests=2&room_types%5B%5D=Entire+home%2Fapt&room_types%5B%5D=Private+room&price_max=207&zoom=15&search_by_map=true&sw_lat=40.4440796767499&sw_lng=-80.0223726855948&ne_lat=40.46520767134712&ne_lng=-79.99937006108308&ss_id=bzfrfbct">AirBnBs</a> (around $100).
      <p><b>Stay here if:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>You like small, independent B&amp;Bs or the Priory was full.</li>
        <li>You want to walk to the Mattress Factory (Inn on the Mexican War Streets is right around the corner).</li>
        <li>You want to stay near the venue (and downtown attractions) but still save a few bucks.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Option 4: Other places in East Liberty</h4> 
      <p>Two good options here: <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/East-Liberty--Pittsburgh--PA--United-States?checkin=06%2F24%2F2016&checkout=06%2F26%2F2016&guests=2&ss_id=g1ozbjjx">AirBnBs</a> ($35+) or the <a href="http://www.acehotel.com/pittsburgh#!">Ace Hotel</a> ($240+).
      <p><b>Stay here if:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>You are looking for the budget option (AirBnB) or the definitely not budget but way too cool option (Ace).</li>
        <li>You want to get a couple friends together and split a 2br or bigger AirBnB.</li>
        <li>You want to see the less-touristy more-neighborhoody side of Pittsburgh.</li>
        <li>You want to be close to the afterparty and any friends staying at the Indigo.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>What's this AirBnB?</h4>
      <p>You can stay in someone's spare bedroom, or in some cases rent their full apartment. It's usually a lot cheaper and more interesting than a hotel. <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/dtasse?s=8">Sign up here</a> and we both get $20 off.</p>

      <a id="transportation" class="anchor"> </a>
      <h2>Transportation</h2>
      <h3>To and from the wedding</h3>
      <p>There will be a shuttle to/from the Priory hotel. For everyone else, we will give you a code for free Uber rides to and from the Mattress Factory. (Uber is an app that lets you hire people to drive you, like a taxi. If you don't have an Uber account, <a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/bp4lq">sign up now!</a>)</p>
      <h3>The rest of the time</h3>
      <p>Pittsburgh's public transportation is not amazing, so driving in or renting a car is not a terrible idea. The Indigo has valet parking for $24/day, or there are nearby pay lots for $1/hr or $14/day (free after 10pm and on Sunday). The Priory has free parking. The Mattress Factory has a free lot at 1300 Brighton Rd.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, to get to the city from the airport, take the 28x bus downtown (if you're staying on the North Side) or to the end of the line (if you're staying in East Liberty), and then either use public buses (Google maps works fine) or <a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/bp4lq">Uber</a>/<a href="https://www.lyft.com/invited/DAN5058">Lyft</a> from there.</p>
      <p>Our <a href="http://pghbikeshare.org/">bike share</a> is great way to get around too! Or rent a bike for the day from <a href="http://www.bikepittsburgh.com/">Golden Triangle</a>.</p>

      <h2>Registry</h2>
        <p>Thanks so much if you're considering a gift for us. We live in a small apartment in bustling San Francisco, and we already have all the household goods we need, AND we love to travel, so we've decided to do something a bit different with our registry: we're going to China! For our honeymoon, we hope to visit the Tibetan areas of Sichuan and Yunnan, so instead of physical goods, we're asking for a bit of money to make that happen.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.honeyfund.com/wedding/tatianddan">Find our honeymoon fund registry here.</a></p>
        <p>Or, if it's easier for you, you can bring a check or cash to the wedding, mail it to us at 201 27th St #5, San Francisco CA 94131, or send it via <a href="https://venmo.com/Dan-Tasse">Venmo</a> or <a href="https://www.paypal.me/dantasse">Paypal</a>. (If you're writing a check, please make it out to one of us, <b>not</b> both, because we don't have a joint account (yet) so we can't easily deposit checks to both of us. Thanks!)</p>
