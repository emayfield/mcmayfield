      <p>6659 Mint Springs Park, Crozet, VA 22932</p>
      <p>1:00 to 5:00</p>

      <p>The events of the weekend start at <a href="https://www.albemarle.org/department.asp?department=parks&relpage=2741">Mint Springs Valley Park</a>. We'll have both shelters reserved for ourselves but the park will, in general, be open to the public. We'll be there starting at 1:00 and catch people as they get into town - people will be coming in and out, stop by for all or part of it! We'll have barbeque brought in from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/gateway-market-charlottesville">Gateway Market</a> and we'll make sure there are also vegetarian options.</p>


      <h2>Sunday: First Colony Winery</h2>
      <p>1650 Harris Creek Road, Charlottesville, VA</p>
      <p>Drinks at 5:00, Ceremony at 6:00. Dinner and dancing to follow</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>We'll be nestled on the edges of the woods just south of Charlottesville. The drive takes about 20 minutes from our hotel venues. There will be bus service available both to and from both of the wedding hotels (see below).</p>

      <p>Catering is being provided by the stellar <a href="http://letoilecatering.com/">L'Etoile</a>. During the afternoon the place will be open for business with regular customers.</p>

      <h2>Monday: Omni Charlottesville</h2>
      <p>212 Ridge McIntire Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22903</p>
      <p>10:00 to 12:00</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>We'll be hosting a goodbye brunch on Charlottesville's Downtown Mall in the hotel atrium. Everyone is welcome! You should expect that this will be quite informal.</p>

      <a id="logistics" class="anchor"> </a>
      <h2>Hotels</h2>
      <p>We have two recommended hotels!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>The <a href="https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/charlottesville">Omni</a></em> has upscale shiny rooms and is the location of our Monday brunch. 
        <li><em>The <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/charlottesville/choso/hoteldetail">Holiday Inn Monticello</a></em> is more affordable and slightly closer to the wedding venue. Use block code WML for a reserved group rate.
      </ul>

      <p>There are also various <a href="https://www.visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/lodging/campgrounds-and-retreats/">Albemarle County campgrounds</a> if you'd prefer a tent, and a number of affordable and happy Airbnb options nearby.</p>

      <h2>Transport</h2>
      <p>Charlottesville is quite accessible for many of the guests, about a 5-6 hour drive from either Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, and a quick drive or train ride from Washington. If you're coming from further away, like Minneapolis, the <a href="http://www.gocho.com/">CHO Airport</a> has reasonably convenient connections through American, Delta, and United.</p>

      <h2>Attire</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Picnic (Saturday):</em> We're going to be at the lake! Be casual and relax. The lake will be open for swimming so if you want to bring a swimsuit, it won't go to waste.
        <li><em>Wedding (Sunday):</em>: On our invitation, we said "Forest party" and we meant it. But for clarity, this is probably close to business casual. It's still a wedding, but not everyone will be wearing a tie, and we'll be outside near the woods for the majority of the night
        <li><em>Brunch (Monday):</em> Casual again! We'll be in a nice hotel atrium but you shouldn't feel constrained by attire.
      </ul>

      <a id="gifts" class="anchor"> </a>
      <h2>Gifts</h2>
      <p>We won't be opening a gift registry for the wedding.</p>

      <p>Christmas is a really special time for us - we both have great childhood memories of the holiday, we got engaged on Christmas Eve 2015. We haven't yet accumulated much together, though, and we want to make that collection meaningful with our friends and family.</p>

      <p>We are asking for Christmas ornaments from our friends and family for our wedding. We will have a Christmas tree at the venue and are hoping you'll be able to drop off your ornaments there. If you buy one ahead of time, that's fantastic. If not, we will have a crafts table next to the tree and invite you to try your hand at making one from scratch!</p>
