      <p>The events of the weekend start at <a href="https://www.albemarle.org/department.asp?department=parks&relpage=2741">Mint Springs Valley Park</a>. We'll have a shelter reserved for our own festivities but the park will, in general, be open to the public. Bring bathing suits if you intend to swim! We expect that people will be trickling in from the highway, the airport, or the hotel throughout the day, so there is no formal start time. The park itself closes at sunset.</p>

      <p>Food will be available starting in the afternoon and continuing through dinner time from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/gateway-market-charlottesville">Gateway Market</a> of Crozet, VA. The atmosphere for the day is decidedly casual and no formalwear of any kind is permitted.</p>

      <p>After dark, for those that want to continue the party, there'll be a recommended evening activity. We don't know what it is yet.</p>
