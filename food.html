      <p>The trouble with exquisite banquets is that neither Brittany nor I have much patience for them. They present a whole host of logistic difficulties - place cards, seating charts, scheduled service by wings of synchronized servers. All that has been delightful at a number of dinners I've attended, and yet it feels entirely distracting and unfun for the type of atmosphere we're picturing.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
           <img class="img-responsive" src="images/bad_watermelon.jpg" height="300" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
           <img class="img-responsive" src="images/good_watermelon.jpg" height="300" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The fancy stuff also has a habit of ruining perfectly good food. Take the humble watermelon and feta salad - one of Brittany's favorites and something we definitely want included during the day. The photo on the left is what typically comes when you get the high-quality, prestige stuff. Beautiful and intricate and surprisingly small and unfulfilling. On the right, on the other hand, you have a bountiful and hearty pile of food that you can snack on at your leisure or eat by the gallon. This is much closer to what both of us are looking for.</p>
